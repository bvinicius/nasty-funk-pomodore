<a href="https://sound-machine.vercel.app/">Sound Machine</a> is a chord player. It's an instrument meant to be fun and easy to play with a computer keyboard or with a large-sized touch screen device.

## How It Works
**Sound Machine** functions based on the **major scale** (all the white keys on the piano, if you're starting from the note **C**). The **C major scale**, for example, has 7 notes (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si ðŸŽµ) and each of them represents a chord that is "relevant" within the scale. That means that any chord you play with **Sound Machine** will be good to hear. No mistakes :)

## How to use it

On its first verion, **Sound Machine** has three main sections:

### Chords

To play any sound, simply press the keys from `1` to `8` on your keyboard. Each of them represent the **degrees** of the scale.

### The main key

The main key tells which note the chords start from. To change the main note you can simply click on each circle button or press the letter keys on your keyboard, as they were the shape of a tiny piano. Here is the full key map:

| Keyboard key    | Note |
| -------- | ------- |
|a|C |
|w|C# |
|s|D |
|e|D# |
|d|E |
|f|F |
|t|F# |
|g|G |
|y|G# |
|h|A |
|u|A# |
|j| B|

### Instruments

To make it interesing, **Sound Machine** has currently 3 instruments that can play the chords simultaneously. Again, just click on each instrument you want to enable/disable or use the keys `v`, `b` and `n` to toggle the Keys, the Bass and the Synth, respectively.
